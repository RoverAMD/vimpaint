So, this is VimPaint - an extraordinary paint program that is as painful to use 
as Vim. Except you do graphics, not text.

To build this wonderful application, you'll need:
- SDL 2.0 with the TTF plugin
- Any C11-capable compiler (though C99 might work too)
- GNU make

Building it is simple - just run "make", then run the vimpaint executable when 
the build finishes.

The program is not ready yet and its license is yet to be determined in the 
future. But, there is and won't be any warranty for this thing... after all, it 
was made just for fun.
